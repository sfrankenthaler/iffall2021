        <h1>Intro Questions</h1> 
        <p>1. Sara Frankenthaler, Major - CommDes; Minors - Marketing & HCI, Junior </p> 
        <p>2. I'm taking this class because it is a CommDes requirement and because I enjoy exploring the applications of design in other fields.</p>
        <p>3. I took CS 131 last semester, but I would not consider myself in any way proficient in Java. I also worked with WordPress for my internship this past summer, but was not really taught how to do CSS.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to understand HTML as a language.</p>
        <p>5. I think that when  designing for a screen you have to consider a wider range of perspectives because screens look different depending on how the user is viewing the site. When designing for paper, the final product can only be seen in one way, so you have more control over the exact final outcome.</p>
        <p>6. https://www.wired.com/ I've always loved the Wired magazine and website layout because I think the UX is very intuitive. There are not too many places to click, but the user knows they can scroll and also click on the menu bar because when you hover over each option it highlights!</p> 
        <p>7. http://digitalmash.com/#life_experience I think this website provides clear communication because there are few avenues to explore, and when you click one of the items in the menu bar it is clear that each menu item takes you to a different project in the portfolio. The arrows to go back to the top are also clear and help with navigation and communication.</p>
        <p>8. https://www.google.com/maps/@38.6440429,-90.4271186,10z Google maps works well because the most common use, finding directions between two places, is the only highlighted option, and the rest fall under the menu bar. This easily directs people to where they most likely need to go without cluttering the home screen with every possible option.</p>
