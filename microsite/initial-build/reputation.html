                    In August 2017, Swift successfully sued David Mueller, a former morning show personality for Denver's KYGO-FM. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for damages from his loss of employment. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault for nominal damages of only a dollar.[183] The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift.[184] Swift thereafter cleared her social media accounts[185] and released "Look What You Made Me Do" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[186] The single was Swift's first number-one U.K. single.[187] It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.[188]
